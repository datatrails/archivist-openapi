Read Current IoTHub devices into Archivist
------------------------------------------

To read current devices from IoTHub POST one of the two connection strings to the **iothubgdr** service as a secret.
**iothubgdr** will import all the devices from that IoTHub into Archivist.

See :ref:`iothubgdr_creation` for details of how to use that API.
